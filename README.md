# ChatGPT-with-Facebook-Messenger
Custom GPT Personal Assistant on Facebook Messenger.
NOTE: THE BOT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT SO EXPECT ERRORS TO ACCURE AND MORE UPDATES WILL COME IN THE FUTURE.

I (Yazan-1st) created a custom personal assistant using OpenAI API to access GPT-3 features, you can make a custom prompt for the bot that he will use to understand who it is and what is its purpose, the bot WIIL HAVE CONTROL of the MOUSE and the KEYBOARD, it will use them to communicate with the user by using the Facebook Messenger window to send and recieve messages.

HOW TO USE THE BOT CORRECTLY:

# HOW TO SETUP THE BOT #

- First thing you need to create a Facebook account for your bot.

- Now you need to download Facebook Messenger and sign in to your bot account.

- Then you can add your bot from your personal account, and then there must appear your name in the Facebook Messenger frinds list.
NOTE: CURRENTLY THE BOT CAN ONLY HAVE ONE FREIND AT A TIME, THE ABILITY TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE FRIEND MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE.

- Make sure that you have the chat with your self opened (so you need to open the chat from your bot account with you).

- You have to keep the Facebook Messenger window opened all the time while the bot is running.

- The Facebook Messenger window must be in dark mod, and DO NOT move the messenger window very often when the bot is running, unless the bot might CLICK ON THE WRONG LOCATION on the screen.
Note: the bot actually relocates the messenger window every time he wants to sned a message but for your safety try not to move the window that often.

- Now you are ready to run the bot and start chatting with him.

# HOW TO GIVE YOUR BOT A PERSONALITY AND A PURPOSE #

- When you downlooad the files you can find a text file with the name (prompt_chat.txt).

- Open the text file and write a prompt that is similar to the following: the following is a conversation between {YOUR NAME} and {THE BOT NAME}, {NOW SAY WHAT THE BOT IS ABOUT WHO CREATED IT WHAT IT CAN DO WHAT IT LOVE TO DO AND SO ON}.
<<BLOCK>>

NOTE: YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE (<<BLOCK>>) in the prompt_chat.txt file in a NEW LINE and DO NOT REMOVE it from the file. 

# OPENAI TOKEN KEY #
THIS THIS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP FOR THE BOT TO WORK.

- You need to create an account on the OpenAI website and go to your account and generate a token and copy that token and paste it in the (API_key.txt) file.
NOTE: for more information on how to get this token from you can google search (how to generate a token key for openai gpt 3).
